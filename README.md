## Design Decisions & Trade-offs ‚öñÔ∏è

### Framework Choice  
- Used **Next.js** for its Server-Side Rendering (SSR) capabilities and performance optimizations.

### UI Library  
- Utilized **ShadCN components** for a minimalist grayscale theme, ensuring a clean and accessible UI.

### State Management  
- Chose **TanStack Query** for seamless server state synchronization, providing a more modern alternative to Redux.

### Form Management  
- Leveraged **Formik** for efficient form handling and **Yup** for schema validation.
